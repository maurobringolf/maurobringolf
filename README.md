* generally interested in software correctness, e.g. testing, type systems, static anaysis and verification
* specifially interested in formal logic and SMT solving
* programming languages and compiler nerd
* open source contributor
* Haskell ex-beginner
* part-time acrobat, e.g. handstands, backflips et cetera

## current work

* Fuzz-testing SMT solvers [education] | *Python, Z3, CVC4, SMT-LIB, formal logic, testing*

  My master thesis project at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I am implementing a semantic method to mutate SMT-LIB formulas in a satisfiability-preserving way to help uncover bugs in widely used solvers like Z3 and CVC4.
  
* Lambda Calculus [personal project] | *Haskell, Lambda Calculus, compiler, interpreter*

  I am writing a compiler for a small subset of Haskell to pure lambda calculus.

* Haskell bindings for Z3 [[opensource](https://github.com/IagoAbal/haskell-z3)] | *Haskell, Z3*

  I help with general maintenance and am extending the bindings to cover more of the Z3 API.

## past work

* Viper Program Verification [education/professional] | *Scala, SMT encoding of program heaps, symbolic execution*
* Web development [professional] | *WordPress, PHP, JavaScript, CSS*
* Babel JavaScript transpiler [[opensource](https://github.com/babel/babel)] | *JavaScript*
