## current work

### Fuzz-testing SMT solvers [education]

*Python, Z3, CVC4, SMT-LIB, formal logic*

My master thesis project at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I am implementing a semantic method to mutate SMT-LIB formulas in a satisfiability-preserving way to help uncover bugs in widely used solvers like Z3 and CVC4.

### Haskell bindings for Z3 [opensource]

*Haskell, Z3*

I help with general maintenance and am extending the bindings to cover more of the Z3 API.

## past work

* Viper Program Verification [education/professional]: *Scala, SMT encoding of program heaps, symbolic execution*
* Web development [professional]: *WordPress, PHP, JavaScript, CSS*
* Babel JavaScript transpiler [opensource]: *JavaScript*
